# The Falls Renderer

I've been purely been making this renderer following with Arseny Kapoulkine renderer https://github.com/zeux/niagara. This is purely for educational purposes and not to be taken as my own work. Here I'm learning about pure GPU driven rendering techniques that involve with mesh shading. This include different levels of details, view frustum culling, occlusion culling all with meshlets. The reason I'm learning from Arseny Kapoulkine so I can understand how to do this with multi indirect draws. My current game engine I'm working is having issues with mesh shading and multi indirect draws so I made this renderer to learn more.
